# bikesharing

## Overview
The purpose of our project is to see if the bike rental business is worth investing in for a different city(which the customer is requesting). One of the key factors we need to look at is tripduration. Finding out how long the trips, how often trips are taken during the week, and looking at breakdowns by a gender demographic will help determine this.

## Results
Using tableau I created 7 different visulizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration. Here is a breakdown of the results:

   - Bike utilization is varied, but trends towards many uses. This would indicate a sizable amount of bikes being needed, even for a samller city

   - From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.

   - There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.

   - The largest number of individuals happen to be male, the women users dont have as large of a peak and unkown users do not have a peak for tripduration.

   - If you look at my trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.

  ## Summary
  Based on the analysis of the bikesharing service based in New York, its easy to see its a popular option for tourists and communters alike. A program on a smaller scale would be beneficial to a smaller city.
